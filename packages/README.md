# YourFritz Packages

If not mentioned otherwise, each YourFritz package is licensed to you under the conditions of GPLv2 - including the one, where this info file is contained or was extracted from, if this text is part of a single image and was not found in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/PeterPawn/yf_bin.git/packages/README.md.

The proposed clause for application of the GPL(v2) license:

applies to ANY provided image as a whole and to EACH single file included in such an image.

The provided images do not include any software, which wasn't licensed by its respective author under conditions, which are compatible with the rights and limitations from GPLv2. Especially no files from AVM are included, neither as binary nor as text, if these files were not published with a license (explicitely or implied) to copy and distribute these files.

You may find a copy of the license text in the file LICENSE, attached to the other content of the image file, if you're reading this text from a single image, or under the following address: https://github.com/PeterPawn/yf_bin.git.

Shell scripts are containing a license identifier according to the SPDX standard (https://spdx.org/). Binary files inherit the license of the source files used to build them. There should be no binary file contained without a corresponding source file or a shell script, that was used to create this binary file.

If a package contains binaries from other projects, these binaries were built from my fork of the Freetz project. My fork, containing some modifications to the original Freetz project, may be found unter the following address: https://github.com/PeterPawn/YourFreetz.git. It contains everything needed to create any of the provided binary files from the corresponding sources (according to clause 3 of terms and conditions of the GPLv2 text).
